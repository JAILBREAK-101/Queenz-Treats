## Problem Statement

 Queen's Treats, a flourishing catering and event planning business, is currently facing challenges in efficiently managing and showcasing their diverse range of services. The absence of a dedicated website is hindering their online presence and accessibility for potential clients. As a result, the business is missing out on opportunities to reach a broader audience and streamline the booking process. To address these issues, Queen's Treats n Event requires a well-designed website that not only showcases their culinary expertise and event planning services but also provides a user-friendly platform for clients to explore offerings, make inquiries, and seamlessly book services online.
